# FanController
 Custom FanController for an 04-08 F150 using a pi pico and mcp2515 CAN Controller

Wiring diagram, following that of a 2010 F150. PCM in wiring diagram is in reference to this controller.
Wiring diagram will eventually be altered to include wiring the Pico itself.

This is completely untested, but intended to be part of a much larger project of incorporating my own information and infotainment
system, even allowing for ota updates using these github repositories. Will link to any other repositories that are part of this
project below. As of now, all included repositories are:
